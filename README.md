### Hello! :v:


I'm Konrad from Wrocław/Poland and I'm a front-end developer also interested in mobile apps development and UI/UX design principles. My goal as a developer is to become a full-stack developer by learning one of the back-end languages, meanwhile mastering my front-end skills :blush:
